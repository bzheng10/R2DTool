    <h1> This is the Regional Resilience Determination Tool (R2D)  application.</h1>

    <p>
This open-source research application, https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/R2D, provides an application researchers can use to predict the damage to a region given a natural hazard. The computations to make these determinations can be prohibitively expensive. To overcome this impedement the user has the option to perform the computations on the Frontera supercomputer. Frontera is located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center and is made available to the user through NHERI DesignSafe, the cyberinfrastructure provider for the distributed NSF funded Natural Hazards in Engineering Research Infrastructure, NHERI, facility.
